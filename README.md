Exercise 5: (score : 1) 
Write a Python program that prompts the user to input a string and converts it to an integer. Use try-except blocks to handle any exceptions that might occur

Exercise 6: (score : 1) 
Write a Python program that prompts the user to input a list of integers and raises an exception if any of the integers in the list are negative.

Exercise 7: (score : 1) 
Write a Python program that prompts the user to input a list of integers and computes the average of those integers. Use try-except blocks to handle any exceptions that might occur.use the finally clause to print a message indicating that the program has finished running.

Exercise 8 : (score : 1) 
Write a Python program that prompts the user to input a filename and writes a string to that file. Use try-except blocks to handle any exceptions that might occur and print a welcome message if there is no exception occurred.

Exercise 9 : (score : 1)
Build a program to manage a university's course catalog. You want to define a base class Course that has the following properties:
course_code: a string representing the course code (e.g., "CS101")
course_name: a string representing the course name (e.g., "Introduction to Computer Science")
credit_hours: an integer representing the credit hours for the course (e.g., 3)
You also want to define two subclasses CoreCourse and ElectiveCourse, which inherit from the Course class.
CoreCourse should have an additional property required_for_major which is a boolean representing whether the course is required for a particular major.
ElectiveCourse should have an additional property elective_type which is a string representing the type of elective (e.g., "general", "technical", "liberal arts").

Exercise 10: (score : 1)
